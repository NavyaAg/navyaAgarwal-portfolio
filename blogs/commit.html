    <h1>How to write good commit messsages ?</h1>
    <p class="blog-text"><b>Having reached till Mark 15, </b>I noticed that I wasn’t efficient at passing good commit messages . They were either very vague or comprised several changes in one commit. As beginners we often tend to overlook these things but a good commit message is as important as the code. This blog tries to cover some conventional commit practices that we should follow.</p>
  <h3>Why good commit message matter?</h3>
  <ul>
      <li>
          <p class="blog-text"><b>It adds clarity to pull requests (PRs) raised- </b>Most projects involve multiple people/teams working on different features. Each entity generally works on their local branch, which they rebase with the master at regular intervals. In such cases, having a broad idea of the code changes implemented by other collaborators via proper commit messages can save a lot of developer time spent in cross-communication.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p class="blog-text"><b>It is key to effective debugging -</b>Let’s say there’s a bug in the application which was not there before. To find out what caused the problem, reading the commit messages could be handy. The proper commit message can save a great deal of time finding the recent changes related to a bug.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p class="blog-text"><b>It makes a code more readable and reusable-</b>If we have a task to add some logic to some part of the code, previous good commit messages can help us find out where and how to add the code.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p class="blog-text"><b>Makes tracking an implementation easier</b></p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p class="blog-text"><b>Provide context to the code reviewer -</b>A good commit message provides basic information to the reviewer about what the commit achieves, without them needing to dive into the code. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p class="blog-text"><b>Help in maintaining a feature log-</b>While writing release notes before shipping, developers can often quickly look at the history of commit messages to have a broad idea of the features added/removed/modified since the last release.</p>
      </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What is a good commit message ?</h3>
  <ul>
      <p class="blog-text">The perfect commit message should have certain qualities:</p>
      <li>
          <p class="blog-text"><b>	It should be understandable </b>even by seeing only the header of the message</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p class="blog-text"><b>	Separate different changes to different commits-</b>This is where I made major mistake. Because I forgot committing changes after every new functionality added , my messages often looked like-“js features added”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p class="blog-text"><b>Should be reasonably small and atomic.</b>It should be just enough, and not too detailed. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p class="blog-text"><b>	It should be unambiguous.-</b>The commit message should describe what changes our commit makes to the behavior of the code, not what changed in the code. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <p class="blog-text"><b>	Use the imperative, present tense - </b>It is easier to read and scan quickly: </p>
          <code>Right: Add feature to alert admin for new user registration  </code>
          <br>
          <br>
            <code> Wrong: Added feature ... (past tense)</code>
      </li>
    </ul>

      <p class="blog-text">Let’s now have a look at Conventional Commits Formats.</p>
     <h3>Formatting</h3>
     <code>
        type: subject <br><br>
        body (optional) <br><br>     
        footer (optional)     
     </code>
     <ol>
         <li class="blog-text" ><b>Type</b>
            <ul><br>
             <li ><code>feat</code>- a new feature</li><br>
             <li ><code>fix</code>- a bug fix</li><br>
             <li ><code>docs</code>- changes in documentation</li><br>
             <li><code>style</code>- everything related to styling</li><br>
             <li><code>refactor</code>- code changes that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature</li><br>
             <li><code>test</code>- everything related to testing</li><br>
             <li><code>chore</code>- updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc</li><br>
         </ul></li>
         <li class="blog-text" ><b>Subject</b>
        <p class="blog-text">This contains a short description of the changes made. It shouldn't be greater than 50 characters.</p></li>
         <li class="blog-text"><b>Body</b>
        <p class="blog-text">The body is used to explain what changes you made and why you made them. Not all commits are complex enough that they need a body, especially if you are working on a personal project alone, and as such writing a body is optional.
            A blank line between the body and the subject is required and each line should have no more than 72 characters.
            </p></li>      
     </ol>
     <p class="blog-text">There are several conventions used by different teams but this is by far most commonly used . </p>
